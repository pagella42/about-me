## About me

I am a full stack developer with more then 4 years of experience.
My skills include React Native, React, Node js, Mongo and others.

**I am currently the frontend lead at Bettervet** where we reinvent the vet care industry by offering telemedicine through an app.

In the past, i cofounded Lavapp, an Argentine based app bringing laundry delivery to people's lives.
